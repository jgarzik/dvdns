In no particular order.

* chroot

* setuid/setgid

* Use IP_PKTINFO with recvmsg()/sendmsg() to stamp the proper
  source addr on all outgoing UDP packets.

* Listen on specific interfaces

* Config file

* think about problems wildcard DNS causes with current database scheme.
  is wildcard support even worth caring about?

* Properly support too-large packets, and the DNS 'TC' truncation bit.

* Use DNS label (pointer) compression for outgoing packets.

* Return value checking needs vast improvement.  currently uses
  g_assert() for some potential runtime conditions.

* Add checking for memory allocation failures (NOTE: check to see
  if GLib simply kills app on alloc failure, checks may not be
  necessary)

* Add logging
