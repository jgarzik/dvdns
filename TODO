In no particular order.

* chroot

* setuid/setgid

* Use IP_PKTINFO with recvmsg()/sendmsg() to stamp the proper
  source addr on all outgoing UDP packets.

* listen on specific interfaces

* config file

* think about problems wildcard DNS causes with current database scheme.

* handle too-large answers (DNS's intentional packet truncation)

* handle DNS label compression correctly

* return value checking needs vast improvement.  currently uses
  g_assert() for some potential runtime conditions.

* add checking for memory allocation failures (NOTE: check to see
  if GLib simply kills app on alloc failure, checks may not be
  necessary)

* add logging
